For Part A, I replaced the terrain textures, including the height map, added a plane for water, and performed the reflection on it in relation to the skybox,
along with the variables to be changes via gui.

For Part B, I wanted to expand on Part A, so I took a noise function, added it to the same water texture, and reflected it, so not only is it a body of water, it simulates the effect
of moving water, much like an ocean. As in Part A, I have made the displacement and reflection variables changeable via gui.
